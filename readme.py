# In this project, you will apply your Python programming skills to create a functional To-Do List Application from scratch. The objective of this project is to reinforce your understanding of Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling while building a practical and interactive application.







#Project Requirements
#User Interface (UI):
#Create a command-line interface (CLI) for the To-Do List Application.
#Display a welcoming message and a menu with the following options:
        #Welcome to the To-Do List App!

        #Menu:
        #1. Add a task
        #2. View tasks
        #3. Mark a task as complete
        #4. Delete a task
        #5. Quit


#To-Do List Features:
#Implement the following features for the To-Do List:
#Adding a task.
#Viewing the list of tasks 
#Marking a task as complete. (Bonus) (Hint: Use string manipulation to add "X" to the end of a task)
#Deleting a task.
#Quitting the application.


#User Interaction:
#Allow users to interact with the application by selecting menu options using input().
#Implement input validation to handle unexpected user input gracefully.

#Error Handling:
#Implement error handling where necessary using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle potential issues.

#Code Organization:
#Organize your code into functions to promote modularity and readability.
#Use meaningful function names with appropriate comments.

#Testing and Debugging:
#Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs.
#Consider edge cases, such as empty task lists or incorrect user input.

#Optional Features (Bonus):
#If you feel adventurous, you can add extra features like task priorities, due dates, or color-coding tasks based on their status.
